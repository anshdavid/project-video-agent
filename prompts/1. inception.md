# Writing tips

The following tips help you write prompts that generate your videos:

- Use descriptive language: Use adjectives and adverbs to paint a clear picture. Description can include a subject, multiple subjects and actions, such as "white concrete apartment building."
- Provide context: If necessary, include background information to help. The background or context in which the subject will be placed is very important. Try placing your subject in a variety of backgrounds like on a busy street, in outer space. What is the subject doing like walking, running, or turning their head
- Reference specific artistic styles: If you have a particular aesthetic in mind, reference specific artistic styles or art movements. You can add keywords to improve generation quality and steer it to closer to intended style, such as shallow depth of field, movie still, minimalistic, surreal, vintage, futuristic, double-exposur
- Camera motion: POV shot, aerial view, tracking drone view, tracking shot, etc
- Adding colors helped make the image look unique and convey intended emotions "muted orange warm tones," "natural light," "sunrise / sunset". Color palettes play a vital role in photography, influencing the mood and emotional impact of an image, and making the image style consistent. For example, a warm, golden palette can infuse a romantic and atmospheric feel into a photograph. Example of color palettes: "pastel blue and pink tones," "dim ambient lighting," "cold muted tones"
